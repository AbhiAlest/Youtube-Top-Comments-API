# Youtube-Top-Comments-API

I find it really annoying when YouTube comments do not showcase the most upvoted comments, but are random assortments of comments, which is why I built this program using the Google/Youtube API. 

Steps:

Simply replace 'API_KEY' with your key and 'VIDEO_ID' with a video's id. I am currently working on an application/extension to make this more interactable/simplistic. 

Also, this development is in Beta, so there are a lot of issues in it.
